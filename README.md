# FastAPI Sepsis Prediction Application Containerized with Docker and Integrated with a Machine Learning Model

## Objective Of This Project

The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model for sepsis classification and deploy it as a web application using FastAPI, thereby enabling real-time predictions.

## Setup

To set up the environment and run the application, follow these steps:

# Prerequisites:
Python 3 installed on your system (Python version lower than 3.10).

# Setup Steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository.

For Linux & MacOS:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running the Application:

Once the environment is set up, run the main app from the repository root.
